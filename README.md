# MIUG-Proj
## Project description  
The project is about basic machine learning methods and fairness in machine learning. We
would like to see the whole process of building a model: preprocessing, training, cross-validation and
testing. The provided dataset is a subset of the North Carolina Policing Dataset ( will be updated gradualy)
## Getting starting 
### Installing project required packages 
In order to avoid compatibility issues we highly recommend creating a virtual environment for the project <br /> 
On Windows
```bash
py -m venv <name_of_virtualenv>
//activate it 
<name_of_virtualenv>\Scripts\activate.bat

```
on linux
```bash
python3 -m venv <name_of_virtualenv>
source <name_of_virtualenv>/bin/activate

``` 
Install the required packages after activating your venv (need to navigate first to your project root if your venv is somewhere else ):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 
# Note
You can use [anaconda ](https://www.anaconda.com/) if you prefer using a gui to install the pacakges but we don't recommend that as using command line and pip package manager will be probably more needed in your future projects. (for installing the requirements same command can be used)
